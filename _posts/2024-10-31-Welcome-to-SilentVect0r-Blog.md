Welcome to all the `Cyber Actors` and `Actresses` out there! Whether you are a `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, or `Experienced` professional, this blog is here to provide valuable insights for every group of cybersecurity personnel.

**Firstly**, I will take you on a journey through the history of cybersecurity and its connection to cyber warfare. You will gain insights into how, when, and why cyberspace became recognized as the fifth domain of warfare. We will explore the evolution of lethal warfare into non-kinetic warfare through the influence of ```APT (Advanced Persistent Threats)```, the story behind this transformation, and how their objectives have changed over time. This evolution has positioned APT as a key factor in cyber warfare, particularly during the moments when it came into the spotlight.

**Secondaly**, You will discover how early psychological warfare evolved and transformed into a combination of psychological warfare and APT warfare, crafting a new form of adversarial non-kinetic cyber warfare. Today, this approach utilizes red, blue, and purple teaming, along with offensive tradecraft and the limitless capabilities of cyber warfare.

**Thirdly**, We will cover the cyber kill chain model in detail, which serves as a blueprint for cyber attacks and provides a breakdown of its stages: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions. This model is also known as a red teaming approach, targeting real-world technologies used by various cyber actors, including APT operations and offensive cyber attack vectors.

**Finally**, Our aim is to train you to think and understand with both offensive and defensive mindsets, equipping you with the latest tradecraft and TTPs. You will develop the ability to think like both red and blue teams, enabling you to conduct adversarial simulated attacks like an APT group while keeping operational security (OpSec) in mind to safeguard cyber infrastructure and businesses.
